# Generalized Security Camera Person Detection Dataset and Model

### Preamble
This project is not yet finished.

The goal of this project is to produce a publically available, general purpose model and easy to use API for detecting people in a surveillance video feed. This will involve the annotation of a new, publically available dataset of security camera images taken from insecam.org, the training of an SSD model, and development of the API.

## 1. Dataset
The dataset will be comprised of 2000+ annotated images from 100+ publically available security camera feeds found at insecam.org.
